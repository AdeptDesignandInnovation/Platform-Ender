First off We would like to mention a few. Even though we did not borrow directly from thier work. 
We did rely on them for inspiration and guidence:

      Voron
      
      HeVort
      
      E3d
      
      VZbot
      
      
 next...
 
      the Z probe is almost un-altered from the Klicky probe user mod for vorons
      which I believe was adapted from anex eng. K2 probe. (fill in names and dets.)
      
      our Z axis relyed very heavily on the RatRig V-core 3 Z design.
      
      thanks everyone in the community that is, has, or will contribute!
